       "A king may move a man, a father may claim a son, but that man can also move himself, and only then
       does that man truly begin his own game. Remember that howsoever you are played or by whom, your soul
       is in your keeping alone, even though those who presume to play you be kings or men of power. When
       you stand before God, you cannot say, 'But I was told by others to do thus,' or that 'Virtue was not
       convenient at the time.' This will not suffice. Remember that."
